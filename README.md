# -Blinkit-Data-Analysis-using-SQL
## Project Objective:
As part of my data analysis practice, I worked on the Blinkit dataset to explore, clean, and analyze the data using Microsoft SQL.
Key highlights of the project include:

ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Standardized categorical values such as Item Fat Content using CASE statements for consistency.

ðŸ›’ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Analyzed sales patterns, item types, fat content distribution, outlet establishment years, and outlet sizes.

ðŸ“ˆ Business Insights â€“ Identified trends in consumer purchasing behavior and outlet performance.

ðŸ›  SQL Techniques Used â€“ JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, subqueries, and aggregate functions for meaningful insights.

ðŸ”Ž Outcome â€“ Derived actionable insights to help understand customer preferences and store-level performance, which can support business decisions in retail and FMCG sectors.

ðŸ‘‰ This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and extract insights from real-world retail data using SQL.
